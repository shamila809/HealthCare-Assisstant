Good morning! How are you feeling today? I am feeling better. I have had a high fever since yesterday. Oh, do you also have a sore throat or cough? Yes. Alright, let me check your temperature. It is slightly high. I will prescribe you some antibiotics and syrup for the cough. How long will it take to feel better? Usually within three to four days, if you rest and take the medicine on time. Alright, I will do that. Thank you, doctor.
